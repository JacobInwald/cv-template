%	INTRODUCTION, SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\textwidth}
    \cvsect{Summary}
I am a Computer Science student at the University of Edinburgh, with a strong background in programming.
At university, my course has required me to acquire a breadth of knowledge, from PCAP analysis to deep learning. 
My various positions in teaching, both inside and outside of computer science have taught me how to communicate my knowledge of a subject effectively.
I have excelled in performing in high pressure environments, and my experience competing on a national level has required me to work well within a larger team. 
I enjoy making programming projects that require applying complex algorithms to interesting problems.
% My interests lie in the intersection of computer science and security, with a focus on security research and network security.
While I have enjoyed my time at university, \textit{applying} this academic knowledge to real-life high-stakes scenarios is something I believe I would excel in.

		{Security Research}
		{Honours Project - Containerizing Exploits}
    {github available on request}
		{
      For my honours project, I am working on containerizing CVE exploit-code pairs to investigate \texttt{gcc}'s security hardening features.      This has required me to do extensive research into security hardening methods, and research a variety of different memory corruption errors in C. 
      As part of this project, I have had to replicate years old security vulnerabilities, often with little documentation. 
      As such, this project has honed my Linux, Dockerfile, C and Bash skills, and taught me a lot about the intricacies of exploits.

		{Classification}
		{Melanoma Classification}
		{\href{https://github.com/JacobInwald/mlp}{github.com}}
		{
      For one of my final-year courses (Machine Learning Practical), me and 2 coursemates trained several deep-learning models for melanoma classification. 
      I wrote the framework that allowed us to successfully train both large transformer based models (ViT-L, SwIN-M), as well as the EfficientNetB0-B7 models across multiple GPUs. 
      We then presented a report comparing the efficacy of these different approacheds to classification.

			A library of password-related tools, from cracking plaintext passwords to cracking hashes. 
		 	% I also expanded this to allow for encryption/decryption using passwords as well as public key cryptography.
			I also included a GPU-accelerated brute-force password cracker, achieving a rate of 4 billion passwords tested a second.

	% 		I wrote a program that used an evolutionary algorithm to generate an image. 
	% 		It created generations of quadrilaterals and then bred them together to find the best fit for the image.
	% 		It created interesting, stylized images, which was my goal.

		{\href{https://github.com/JacobInwald/OCRAlgebra}{github.com}}
		{
			I wrote a neural network that achieved 90\% accuracy on the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) character set. 
			To make this a challenge, I did not allow myself to use any external libraries, apart from one for random number generation. 
      This meant that I had to write a python-based machine learning backend from scratch.
